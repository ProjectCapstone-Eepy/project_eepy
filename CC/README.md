# Explanation of Work by the Cloud Computing Team

### 1. Cloud Computing API
Here, the Cloud Computing Team creates API endpoints to be delivered to the Mobile Development Path to load the model provided by the Machine Learning Path. We use Python as the programming language to simplify configuration on the Cloud Computing Platform.

### 2. Cloud Computing Documentation
Here, the Cloud Computing Team prepares documentation on how the cloud processes work in the application we are developing and creates documentation on the service costs we use to estimate monthly expenses for development purposes. <br>
